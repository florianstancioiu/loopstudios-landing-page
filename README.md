- CSS nesting
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tablet-first workflow (because the free plan doesn't include a mobile design)
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- I learned to use the `<picture>` element
- I learned to set each word from a paragrah on new line with CSS

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [<picture>: The Picture element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/picture) - Helped me set different image versions for mobile and desktop
- [Can CSS force a line break after each word in an element?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23889196/12159189) - Helped me set each word on a new line using plain CSS
